## The Cycle That Changes Everything

In Article 4, we walked through the mechanics of a single policy loan. One deal. One loan. One repayment. Straightforward.

But IBC isn't about a single transaction. It's about a **cycle** — a repeatable process that accelerates every time you complete it.

Nelson Nash called this the "Be Your Own Banker" process. Real estate investors who implement it call it something simpler: **they never run out of deal money.**

Here's the cycle:

**Step 1: Capitalize.** Fund your policy with premium payments. Cash value grows.

**Step 2: Borrow.** Take a policy loan when a deal appears. Capital deployed in 1-3 days.

**Step 3: Deploy.** Use the capital for earnest money, down payments, renovations, bridge financing — whatever the deal requires.

**Step 4: Recover.** When the deal closes, sells, refinances, or cash-flows, you recover your deployed capital.

**Step 5: Repay.** Pay back the policy loan (plus interest) from the recovered capital.

**Step 6: Repeat.** Your cash value has been growing the entire time. Your policy is now bigger (from ongoing premiums). You're ready for the next deal with more capital than you started with.

That's the infinite capital strategy. Not because the money is literally infinite — it's not — but because the capital recycles through your system and grows at every stage.

## Why the Math Keeps Compounding

Let me show you why this cycle is more powerful than it appears at first glance.

**Year 1:** You start a policy with $50,000 annual premium. End of year cash value: approximately $43,000 (first-year costs are highest). You do 1 deal using a $25,000 policy loan. Deal nets $35,000 profit. You repay the loan. Your cash value is now growing on the full base.

**Year 2:** You continue $50,000 in premiums. Cash value grows to approximately $98,000. You do 2 deals using policy loans totaling $60,000 at various points. Deals net $72,000 combined. You repay loans as deals close. Cash value keeps compounding underneath.

**Year 3:** Cash value: approximately $158,000. You do 3 deals. Total policy loans: $95,000 (not all at once — staggered as deals open and close). Deals net $105,000. You repay loans. Cash value continues its guaranteed growth.

**Year 5:** Cash value: approximately $285,000. You're doing 4-5 deals per year. Your available capital for any single deal is now $250,000+. You haven't changed your premium. The system grew because capital cycled through it repeatedly.

**Year 10:** Cash value: approximately $650,000. You've funded 35-40 deals. Total interest paid on all policy loans over 10 years: roughly $15,000-$25,000. What would you have paid hard money lenders? Easily $150,000-$250,000 in points and interest alone. The savings compound too.

**The key insight:** Your policy grows from two sources simultaneously.

1. **Premium contributions** — The new money you put in each year
2. **Internal growth** — Guaranteed interest plus dividends on the entire cash value

Both of these continue uninterrupted regardless of how many policy loans you have outstanding. The policy doesn't care that you borrowed $95,000. It's still growing on the full cash value.

This is what Nash meant by **"constant compounding."** Traditional capital deployment forces a choice: your money is either earning returns in savings OR deployed in a deal. With IBC, it's doing both.

## Velocity of Money

Real estate investors understand the concept of **velocity of money** — how many times you can deploy the same dollar in a given period. Higher velocity means more deals, more returns, more growth.

IBC dramatically increases your velocity of capital. Here's why:

**Without IBC:**
- You have $100,000 in savings
- You deploy it into a flip
- For 6 months, it earns nothing in savings (it's deployed)
- The flip closes, you get $100,000 back plus profit
- You park it in savings while you find the next deal
- For 2 months, it earns 0.5% in the bank
- You deploy again
- Annual velocity: maybe 1.5x

**With IBC:**
- You have $100,000 in cash value
- You take a $100,000 policy loan and deploy it into a flip
- For 6 months, your cash value keeps earning ~5% (it never left the policy)
- The flip closes, you repay the loan
- Your cash value is immediately available for the next loan
- No idle period — you can borrow again the same day you repay
- Annual velocity: 2x or higher, AND your base capital grew during deployment

The difference isn't just the number of deals. It's that **your capital grows at every stage** — while deployed, between deals, and from ongoing premium contributions.

Over a decade, this velocity advantage compounds into hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## The Waterfall Effect

Here's something that happens around year 3-5 that most new IBC practitioners don't anticipate.

Your policy's annual growth — from guaranteed interest and dividends alone, not including premiums — starts exceeding the interest you pay on policy loans.

Example: In year 5, your cash value is $285,000. Annual guaranteed growth at 4%: $11,400. Dividends at ~2%: $5,700. **Total annual growth: $17,100.**

If your average policy loan balance during the year is $100,000 at 5% interest, your annual loan cost is $5,000.

**Your policy is earning $17,100 while you're paying $5,000 in loan interest.** Net annual gain from the banking system alone: $12,100 — before considering the returns on the deals you funded.

This is the waterfall effect. The policy's growth overtakes and then dwarfs the cost of borrowing against it. At this point, the cost of capital for your deals is effectively negative — your banking system generates more than it costs to operate.

Nash described this as the whole point. You're not just funding deals. **You're running a profitable banking operation on top of your investment business.**

## Stacking Policies

Active investors often start a second (or third) policy once their deal flow outgrows their first policy's capacity.

This isn't a gimmick. It's strategic.

**Policy 1** was started in year 1. By year 5, it has $285,000 in cash value and is growing at $17,000+ per year from internal returns alone.

**Policy 2** is started in year 3 with the same $50,000 annual premium, funded from deal profits. By year 5 (its year 3), it has approximately $158,000 in cash value.

**Combined cash value in year 5: $443,000.** Combined available capital for deals: $400,000+. Combined annual internal growth: approximately $25,000+.

Some investors I work with are running 3-4 policies, started at different times, creating a **ladder of capital** that ensures they always have available cash value regardless of how many deals are in progress.

Each policy is a separate banking system. Each one grows independently. Each one can be borrowed against independently. Together, they create a capital infrastructure that scales with your business.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Let me paint the picture of what an investor's year looks like five years into IBC.

**January:** A wholesaler brings you a 4-unit building. You need $40,000 for earnest money and inspections. You call the insurance company Monday, money arrives Wednesday. You wire earnest money Thursday.

**March:** The 4-unit closes. You funded the down payment through a combination of policy loan ($80,000) and a conventional loan. The property cash-flows $2,800/month. You plan to hold long-term.

**April:** A flip opportunity surfaces. You take a second policy loan ($55,000) from your second policy for the renovation. Your first policy still has $80,000 outstanding, but it's collateralized by the rental and the loan interest is less than the property's cash flow.

**July:** The flip sells. Net profit: $48,000. You repay the $55,000 second policy loan plus $1,375 in interest. You deposit $20,000 of the profit into your second policy as additional PUA premium. The system gets bigger.

**September:** Market dips. Several properties hit the market at distressed prices. Your peers are panicking — their HELOCs are frozen, hard money is quoting 15%. You have $180,000 in unencumbered cash value. You borrow $120,000 and buy a 6-unit at 70 cents on the dollar.

**December:** You review your year. Four deals funded. Zero hard money points paid. Zero partner equity surrendered. Total policy loan interest for the year: $8,200. Your cash value grew by $23,000 from internal returns. Your deal profits totaled $175,000.

**Net cost of your banking system: negative.** The system paid you to use it.

## The Mindset Shift

Here's the part that takes longest to click.

Most real estate investors think of themselves as **deal people.** They find deals, analyze deals, execute deals. Capital is something they chase, borrow, and pay for.

IBC investors think of themselves as **capital people** who happen to do real estate deals. The deals are important — but the capital system is *more* important, because it's what makes every deal possible, profitable, and repeatable.

Nash had a phrase: **"Think long range."** He wasn't just talking about patience. He was talking about building a system that compounds for decades — not just chasing the next deal.

The investors I work with who get the most out of IBC are the ones who treat their policies with the same seriousness they treat their property portfolios. They fund them consistently. They track their cash value growth. They plan their loan activity strategically. They think of the policy as a business asset — because it is.

In Article 6, we'll tie this all together. Because the truth is, as a real estate investor using IBC, you're not running one business. You're running two. And the second one — your banking system — might be the more valuable one.
