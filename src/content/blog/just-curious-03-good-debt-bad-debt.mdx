You've probably heard the debate: "Good debt builds wealth, bad debt destroys it."

On one side, you've got the Dave Ramsey crowd. All debt is evil. Cut up your credit cards. Pay cash for everything. Live like no one else so later you can live like no one else.

On the other side, you've got the leverage bros. Debt is a tool. Use other people's money. Millionaires don't pay cash—they borrow at low rates and invest the difference.

Both sides are loud. Both sides are confident. And both sides are missing something important.

## The Standard Framework

Here's how the "good debt vs bad debt" argument typically goes:

**Good debt** appreciates or generates income. A mortgage builds equity in a home that (hopefully) gains value. Student loans increase your earning potential. Business loans fund revenue-generating activities. The asset you're financing is worth more than the debt you're carrying. Net positive.

**Bad debt** depreciates or funds consumption. Credit cards for clothes and vacations. Car loans on vehicles that lose 20% the moment you drive off the lot. Financing a lifestyle you can't afford. The thing you bought is worth less than what you owe. Net negative.

Simple enough. One type of debt works for you; the other works against you. The smart play is to use the first kind and avoid the second.

Except... is that actually the right question?

## Dave Ramsey's Counter-Argument

Dave Ramsey rejects the whole framework. To him, debt is debt. Period.

He's seen too many "good debt" mortgages become foreclosures. Too many "smart leverage" plays turn into bankruptcies. His argument: debt is risk. All debt. When you owe money, someone else has a claim on your future. That claim doesn't disappear when life throws you a curveball.

The 2008 financial crisis proved his point. Millions of people thought they had "good debt" in their homes. Until they didn't.

Dave isn't wrong about the risk. He's just not asking the right question.

## The Leverage Argument

The leverage crowd has their own compelling case.

If you can borrow money at 5% and invest it at 8%, you're making money on the spread. That's how banks work. That's how corporations work. Why shouldn't you work the same way?

Rich people don't pay cash. They borrow against assets. They use debt strategically to multiply returns. The whole game, they'll tell you, is learning to use debt as a tool instead of fearing it.

And mathematically, they're not wrong. If you've got a stable income, low interest rates, and good investment returns, leverage can accelerate wealth building.

But here's what they don't mention: whose tool are you holding?

## The Question Neither Side Asks

Both camps—the debt eliminators and the debt optimizers—are debating the same question: **What should I use debt for?**

A mortgage for a house? Good debt.
A loan for a car? Bad debt.
A student loan for a degree? Depends who you ask.
Credit cards? Definitely bad.

But there's a different question hiding underneath. One that's more fundamental:

**Who benefits from the financing function in your life?**

Think about it. Every time you finance something—a house, a car, equipment for your business, your education—money flows somewhere. Interest gets paid to someone. Spread gets earned by someone.

The debate about good versus bad debt is really a debate about *what* you should finance. But what about *who* profits from the financing itself?

## A Different Lens

Let's look at a mortgage through this lens.

The traditional view: A mortgage is "good debt" because you're building equity in an appreciating asset. You're leveraging the bank's money to own something valuable. Smart move.

But step back. Over a 30-year mortgage on a $400,000 home at 7%, you'll pay roughly $560,000 in interest. More than the house itself. That interest flows to the bank. They earned it by controlling the financing function—not by building the house, not by maintaining it, not by living in it. Just by providing the capital.

Is the mortgage "good debt" because you bought a house? Or is the mortgage "good debt" *for the bank* because they captured half a million dollars in interest payments from your labor over three decades?

The answer might be "both." But only one of those perspectives gets discussed.

## The Same Question, Applied Everywhere

Apply this lens to any financing decision. Car loans, student loans, business credit—in every case, someone else earns from your need for capital. 

Your car depreciates while the finance company collects interest. You take business risk while the bank's return is contractually guaranteed. You invest in education while lenders collect for decades.

The pattern is always the same: you bear the risk, they earn the spread.

## What the Banks Actually Know

Here's what's interesting: banks don't care about the good debt/bad debt distinction. They care about one thing—will you pay them back?

A mortgage and a credit card balance are both assets on the bank's books. Both generate interest income. One has better collateral than the other, which is why mortgage rates are lower. But from the bank's perspective, both are revenue streams.

The "good debt vs bad debt" framework is a borrower's framework. It's how we comfort ourselves about the financing decisions we make. *At least this debt is building something.*

But the bank doesn't need that comfort. They know the truth: as long as you're borrowing, they're earning.

## The Real Question

So here's where we land:

Dave Ramsey is right that debt carries risk. The leverage optimizers are right that debt can be a tool. But neither of them is asking the question that matters most:

**Who controls the banking function in your life?**

Not what you borrow for. Who benefits when you borrow at all.

Every financing decision you make—good debt, bad debt, smart debt, dumb debt—creates a relationship where someone else earns money from your need for capital. That's not good or bad. It's just the system.

The question is whether you've ever stopped to notice it.

## What's Really Going On

Think back to what we covered in the last article. Banks profit from your deposits *and* your loans. They've positioned themselves as the inevitable middleman in your financial life.

The good debt/bad debt debate keeps you focused on *what* to finance. It distracts from the more fundamental question of *who* profits from every financing decision you make.

So if both sides of the debt debate are missing something... what exactly are the banks doing?

And is there any way to do it yourself?
