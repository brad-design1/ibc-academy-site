## More Than You Think

How much do banks cost your business?

More than you think. And I'm not talking about the interest rate.

Most business owners can tell you their loan rates. 7.9% on the equipment loan. 8.2% on the line of credit. Maybe 6.5% on the SBA loan they took out three years ago.

Add it up. On a million-dollar business carrying $300,000 in various financing, you're looking at $20,000 to $25,000 a year in interest. Real money. Money that leaves your business and never comes back.

But that number — the one you can calculate on a napkin — is just the visible cost. It's the part of the iceberg above the waterline.

Below the surface, there's a whole category of costs that never show up on a bank statement. And for most businesses, the invisible costs dwarf the visible ones.

## The Visible Cost: Interest You Can Calculate

Let's start with what you already know.

An HVAC contractor in Texas — let's call him Ray — replaces a work van every four years. The Ford Transit costs $52,000. He finances through Ford Credit at 7.9% over 48 months. Monthly payment: $1,275.

Over four years, Ray pays roughly $9,200 in interest on one van. Over twenty years and five vans? That's $45,000 in interest. Just on vans. Not counting the equipment loans, the credit line, the occasional bridge financing.

A chiropractor named Marcus walked into his bank for $80,000 in equipment — X-ray systems, adjustment tables, the basics of running a practice. The bank gave him 8.2% over five years. Total interest: $17,800.

These are real numbers. You can see them on the amortization schedule. They're painful, but at least they're knowable.

The problem is everything you *can't* see.

## Invisible Cost #1: The Approval Delay

Here's a story that should make every business owner uncomfortable.

A real estate wholesaler in Atlanta — Derek — found a property on a Thursday afternoon. Estate sale. Tax auction scheduled for the following Tuesday. He had the deal locked: purchase at $185,000, buyer lined up at $210,000. That's $25,000 in profit.

One problem. He needed $15,000 in earnest money by Monday morning to halt the auction. His checking account had $6,200.

He called his hard money lender. The lender needed to see the deal, run numbers, get documentation. Earliest realistic funding: Wednesday.

Wednesday was one day *after* the auction.

Derek sat in his truck watching a $25,000 fee evaporate — not because the deal was bad, not because the numbers didn't work, but because he couldn't access $15,000 in seventy-two hours.

That deal eventually got saved through a mentor's personal loan. But think about how many Dereks are out there, losing deals every week because the bank's timeline doesn't match the opportunity's timeline.

Two weeks for equipment financing. Three weeks for an SBA loan. Six weeks for a commercial mortgage. Meanwhile, the opportunity has a deadline that doesn't care about your bank's underwriting committee.

## Invisible Cost #2: Collateral Requirements

When you borrow from a bank, they don't just charge interest. They want security.

Equipment loans require liens on the equipment. Credit lines require blanket liens on business assets. SBA loans often require personal guarantees and liens on your home.

Every asset pledged as collateral is an asset that can't be deployed elsewhere. It's capital that's frozen — technically yours, practically the bank's until the loan is paid.

For a business doing $1-2 million in revenue, the total collateral tied up across various lending relationships can easily reach $200,000 to $500,000. That's capital you can't use to hire, expand, or seize an opportunity — because someone else has a claim on it.

## Invisible Cost #3: The Credit Line That Disappears

This one is the cruelest.

In 2008, banks pulled credit lines from businesses that had never missed a payment. Profitable businesses. Good customers. Didn't matter. The banks were scared, so they pulled the lifelines.

It happened again in 2020. Businesses that needed capital most — because revenue had cratered overnight — discovered that their "available" credit wasn't available anymore. The bank decided the risk had changed. The terms changed with it.

Here's the pattern: banks extend credit when you don't need it and pull it when you do. They're fair-weather friends with contractual power over your cash flow.

If you've ever relied on a credit line to make payroll during a slow month, you know the feeling in your stomach when you realize that line might not be there next time.

---

## Invisible Cost #4: Restrictive Covenants

Read the fine print on your business loans.

Many credit agreements include covenants — rules about what you can and can't do with your business while the loan is outstanding. Maintain certain debt ratios. Don't take on additional debt without permission. Don't make capital expenditures above a certain threshold without approval.

These restrictions don't show up as a dollar amount. But they cost you in flexibility. The expansion you couldn't pursue because your lender said no. The equipment upgrade you delayed because it would violate a covenant. The opportunity you passed on because you weren't allowed to take on more debt.

The bank isn't your partner. They don't share in your upside. But they get a say in your decisions.

---

## Invisible Cost #5: The Deals You Didn't Do

This is the biggest cost of all, and it's the one nobody tracks.

How many opportunities have you passed on because you couldn't move fast enough? How many deals did you lose because you didn't have capital available at the exact moment it was needed?

Derek's $25,000 deal almost disappeared. Ray's HVAC business suffered every time a van broke down and Ford Credit needed two weeks to process the replacement. Marcus the chiropractor couldn't even consider acquiring a second practice until years after the opportunity first appeared — because he was still paying off the bank on his first round of equipment.

You don't see these costs on any statement. But they compound. Every missed deal is revenue you didn't earn, which means capital you didn't accumulate, which means the *next* deal is harder to grab. It's a downward spiral that starts with one simple problem: you don't control your own capital.

## Nash's Equipment Financing Example

Nelson Nash laid this out with brutal clarity in *Becoming Your Own Banker*.

His example: a logger in Eastern North Carolina. Very profitable. Replacing a logging truck every four years, financing through Associates Finance. The logger is doing well. Associates Finance is doing *better*.

Nash walked through what happens when the logger starts financing equipment through his own system instead of through the third-party lender. Same trucks. Same payments. Same cash flow. Different destination for the dollars.

The result? Each time the logger took one more piece of equipment financing under his own control, every number on the right side of the ledger improved. More cash value. More retirement income. More to the next generation. The insurance company's dividend scale didn't change. The interest rates didn't change. The only variable was the logger's *decision* about who performed the banking function.

As Nash put it: the actions of the owner have a greater bearing on the results than even the insurance company.

The financial gurus complained the numbers wouldn't work in a low-interest-rate environment. So Nash added Illustration #6 in 2010 — paid premiums for five years instead of four — and the results were about the same or better. The concept works across interest rate environments because it was never about the rate. It was about who captures the profit from the financing function.

## Adding It Up

Let's try to quantify the full cost for a business doing $1-2 million in revenue.

**Visible costs:**
- Interest on equipment loans, credit lines, SBA financing: $20,000-$40,000/year

**Invisible costs:**
- Deals lost to approval delays (even one per year at $10,000-$25,000): $10,000-$25,000/year
- Opportunity cost of tied-up collateral: $5,000-$15,000/year
- Flexibility cost of restrictive covenants: hard to quantify, but real
- Risk of pulled credit lines in downturns: potentially catastrophic

Conservative estimate? A business in that range is losing **$50,000 to $100,000 per year** to bank dependency — visible and invisible combined.

Over a decade, that's half a million to a million dollars. Not lost to bad decisions. Not lost to market downturns. Lost to a system that extracts value from your business at every turn.

## The Question

Here's what struck me when I first worked through these numbers.

Business owners are some of the sharpest people I know. They negotiate vendor contracts down to the penny. They optimize operations ruthlessly. They track every dollar of revenue and every line item of expense.

But most of them have never added up the full cost of their banking relationships. They see the interest. They don't see the delays, the tied-up collateral, the pulled lines, the missed deals, the covenants, the opportunity cost.

The interest rate is just the beginning.

What if you had capital you controlled — no applications, no approvals, no collateral requirements, no two-week waiting period? Capital that was available when you needed it, on your timeline, for whatever purpose you decided?

That's not a fantasy. It's a function. And in the next article, we'll look at how it actually works.
