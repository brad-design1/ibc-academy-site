Let's talk about what banks actually do with your money.

Not what the commercials show you—the smiling families and golden retrievers. What actually happens after you deposit your paycheck.

If you've been following this series, you know that [somewhere between $2 and $5 million will flow through your hands](/blog/just-curious-01-money-through-your-hands) over your working lifetime. You know that [someone profits from every financing decision](/blog/just-curious-02-silent-partner) you make. And you know that the [real question isn't "good debt vs. bad debt"](/blog/just-curious-03-good-debt-bad-debt)—it's who controls the banking function in your life.

Now let's look at the mechanics of how banking actually works. Because once you see it, you can't unsee it.

## A Simple Question

When you deposit $1,000 at your bank, where does that money go?

Most people assume it sits in a vault somewhere. Maybe in a safety deposit box with their name on it. Waiting patiently for the day they need it back.

That's not what happens.

Not even close.

## The 10% Rule

Here's how commercial banking actually works. It's called fractional reserve banking, and it's been the foundation of the banking system for centuries.

You deposit $1,000.

The bank keeps about $100 in reserves. That's the "fractional" part.

The other $900? Gone. Lent out to someone else. Used as the raw material for a car loan, a mortgage, a business line of credit.

Your money isn't sitting in a vault. It's been deployed—working for someone else, earning interest for the bank.

This isn't conspiracy theory. It's literally how the system is designed to work. Banks don't hide this. They just don't advertise it on billboards.

## The Spread

Now here's where it gets interesting.

What does the bank pay you for the privilege of using your $1,000?

Check your savings account statement. You're probably earning somewhere between 0.01% and maybe 4% if you locked it in a CD. Let's be generous and say you're getting 0.5% on a standard savings account.

That's $5 per year on your $1,000 deposit.

Meanwhile, the bank takes that same money—your money—and lends it out. Car loan? 7%. Credit card? 20%. Personal loan? 12%.

Let's use conservative numbers. The bank lends your $900 at 7%. That's $63 per year.

You get $5. They make $63. From your deposit.

This difference has a name in the banking industry: **net interest margin**. It sounds sophisticated and technical. But strip away the jargon and it's simple arithmetic.

They pay you almost nothing. They charge borrowers a lot. They pocket the difference.

With your money.

## The Business Model

This is the entire banking business model. Collect deposits. Make loans. Profit from the spread.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

Everything else—the mobile app, the rewards points, the "relationship banking" pitch, the free checking—all of it exists to get you to deposit more money so they have more raw material to lend out.

You're not the customer. You're the product.

When you walk into a bank branch, you might think you're the important person in the relationship. After all, it's your money.

But from the bank's perspective, you're a supplier. You supply the capital they need to run their business. The customers—the people the bank really cares about—are the borrowers paying 7%, 12%, 20% interest.

You supply the inventory. Borrowers generate the profit. The bank stands in the middle, making money on both sides of the transaction.

## Why Bank Buildings Are So Nice

Ever notice how fancy bank buildings are?

The marble floors. The heavy wood desks. The brass fixtures. The prime real estate downtown. The executive portraits in gold frames.

Banks can afford all of that because this business model works *really, really well*.

Think about it. They're paying you half a percent and charging borrowers seven percent or more. On every dollar they collect and lend, they're capturing that entire spread.

Do this with billions of dollars in deposits, and you can afford a lot of marble.

## The Math Nobody Shows You

Let's make this concrete.

Say a bank has $100 million in deposits. Not a huge bank—just a regional player.

They pay depositors an average of 0.5%. That costs them $500,000 per year.

They lend out $90 million (keeping 10% in reserves) at an average rate of 6%. That earns them $5,400,000 per year.

Their net interest margin: $4,900,000.

Per year. Before we even talk about the fees they charge for everything from overdrafts to wire transfers to ATM usage.

Now you know why there's a bank branch on every corner.

## The Part That Should Make You Think

Here's what most people never put together.

When you finance a car at the dealership—7% interest, let's say—where does the money come from?

Often, it comes from a bank. Or a credit union. Or a finance company backed by a bank.

And where did the bank get that money?

From depositors. People like you.

So follow the chain: You deposit money at 0.5%. The bank lends it to someone else at 7%. That someone else might even be you—buying a car, financing a house, carrying a credit card balance.

You're supplying the capital for your own loans.

And paying for the privilege.

## It's Not Evil, It's Just Business

I want to be clear about something. This isn't a rant against banks. Banks aren't villains.

They're providing a legitimate service. They connect people who have money with people who need money. They take on risk. They keep the economy moving. They've been doing this for centuries.

The system works. It's not a scam. It's just a business model.

But here's the thing about business models: once you understand how they work, you can make different decisions.

A grocery store makes money by buying products wholesale and selling them retail. Nothing wrong with that. But once you understand the markup, you might choose to buy in bulk. Or grow your own vegetables. Or shop somewhere else entirely.

Banks make money by borrowing cheaply from depositors and lending expensively to borrowers. Nothing wrong with that either. But once you understand the spread, you start asking different questions.

## Questions Worth Asking

Like:

What if you could be on the other side of that spread?

What if you didn't have to supply capital to institutions and then rent it back at a markup?

What if the interest you paid went somewhere other than a bank's profit margin?

What if you could control more of the banking function—the profitable part—in your own life?

These aren't rhetorical questions. There are answers. But we're not there yet in this series.

For now, I just want you to see the system for what it is.

Your bank isn't a vault. It's a business. A very profitable business that runs on the capital you supply.

## One More Thing

Remember how I mentioned that $2-5 million flows through your hands over your lifetime?

Now think about how much of that flow passes through banks. Your paycheck gets deposited there. Your mortgage payments leave from there. Your car loans, your credit cards, your business accounts—all flowing through institutions that profit from the spread between what they pay and what they charge.

For most people, virtually 100% of their financial life flows through someone else's banking system.

The question isn't whether banking will happen in your life. Banking must happen. Money has to flow somewhere. It has to be stored somewhere. It has to be deployed somewhere.

The question is who profits from the banking function.

Right now, the answer is probably: not you.

Now you might be wondering about your retirement accounts—the 401(k)s and IRAs where you're told to put your savings. Where does that money actually go? And who profits from it?

That's what we'll explore next.
