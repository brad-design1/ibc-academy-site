## A Grocery Store Owner Who Discovered Something About Banking

Let me tell you about a grocery store owner who accidentally discovered something about banking.

Nelson Nash — a forester, pilot, and lifelong systems thinker — used a simple grocery store to explain what might be the most overlooked reality in business finance. Not because groceries are complicated. Because they're the opposite.

Everyone understands a grocery store. You buy wholesale. You sell retail. You manage inventory, cash flow, and margins. Nothing exotic. Nothing mysterious.

But Nash saw something hiding inside the grocery business that almost nobody notices. Something that applies to *your* business right now. Today. Whether you run a construction company, a dental practice, a marketing agency, or a landscaping crew.

Here's the insight: **The grocery store owner isn't just in the grocery business. He's also in the banking business.**

And so are you.

## Two Businesses Under One Roof

Walk through the economics of a grocery store for a minute.

The owner buys a can of peas from his supplier for 57 cents. Puts it on the shelf. Sells it for 60 cents. Three cents profit. Razor-thin margins — that's the grocery business.

But there's a second business running underneath the surface.

The owner had to *finance* everything before he could sell a single can. The building. The refrigeration. The shelving. The employees. The inventory itself. All of that required capital — borrowed capital, in most cases — deployed before a single customer walked through the door.

That's not groceries. That's banking.

He's storing capital. He's deploying capital. He's managing the timing between when money goes out and when it comes back in. He's extending credit to suppliers and customers. He's carrying inventory that represents money tied up in goods that haven't been sold yet.

Two businesses. One roof. And here's what Nash noticed: **the banking side might be more valuable than the grocery side.**

Because those three-cent margins on peas only matter if the capital underneath keeps flowing. Stop the capital, and the shelves go empty. Stop the financing function, and the grocery business dies — no matter how good the product is.

The grocery business is what everyone sees. The banking business is what actually makes it all work.

## Now Look at Your Business

Let's bring this home.

Do you extend net-30 or net-60 terms to your clients? That's financing. You're lending your customers the use of your product or service for 30 to 60 days — interest-free — before they pay you. You've become their bank.

Do you carry inventory? That's capital deployed. Every dollar sitting on your shelves or in your warehouse is money you've already spent that hasn't come back yet. You're warehousing capital, just like a bank warehouses deposits.

Do you finance equipment? Trucks, machines, software, build-outs? That's the banking function in its purest form — deploying capital today to generate revenue tomorrow.

Do you cover payroll before your receivables come in? That's a short-term loan — from you to your business. You're bridging a cash flow gap with your own capital.

Do you carry a line of credit to smooth out seasonal swings? You're borrowing from a bank to perform the banking function in your own operation.

**Congratulations. You're already in the banking business.**

You've been in it since the day you opened your doors. You just never called it that. Nobody does. Because when people hear "banking," they think of marble floors and brass fixtures. They think of a *building*. An institution. A place you go to ask permission.

But banking isn't a building. It never was.

## Banking Is a Function, Not a Building

This is the line from Nelson Nash that changes how you see everything:

**Banking is a function, not a building.**

Strip away the logos and the branches and the apps. What does a bank actually *do*?

Two things:
1. It stores capital.
2. It deploys capital.

That's the entire business. Everything else — the tellers, the loan officers, the compliance department, the Super Bowl commercials — is window dressing around those two functions.

Capital flows in. Capital flows out. The bank earns the spread between what it pays to acquire capital and what it charges to deploy it.

Now re-read that description and think about your business.

Capital flows in — from revenue, from your personal funds, from credit lines. Capital flows out — to payroll, inventory, equipment, overhead, taxes. You manage the timing. You manage the risk. You decide where capital gets deployed and when it comes back.

**You are performing the banking function every single day.**

The only question — and this is the question that should keep you up at night — is: *who profits from it?*

---

## The Spread That's Making Someone Else Rich

Here's how the math works right now in your business.

When you have surplus cash, where does it go? Probably a business checking account earning close to nothing. Maybe a money market at 0.5% if you're diligent. Maybe it sits in your personal account doing even less.

That's the capital you've *supplied* to the banking system. The bank takes your deposit, says "thank you," and lends it out at 7%, 8%, 10% — or bundles it into instruments that earn even more.

Then when *you* need capital — for a new truck, a facility expansion, a bridge loan to cover a slow quarter — you go back to that same bank and borrow money at 7% to 20%, depending on the type of financing.

Think about what just happened.

You supplied the capital at 0.5%. You borrowed it back at 7% or more. The difference — that 6.5% spread — is the bank's profit margin.

**Earned with your money. On capital you created.**

You did the hard part. You built a business. You generated revenue. You created the surplus that made the deposit possible. And then an institution you don't own captured the spread between your deposit and your loan.

That's not a conspiracy. It's just business. *Their* business.

But here's the question Nash forces you to ask: What if that were *your* business instead?

## Shopping at Someone Else's Store

Nash had a way of making this visceral. He told the story of a logging company owner — twenty years in the business — who had financed every truck through commercial lenders his entire career.

One day the logger realized something: the finance company was borrowing money from insurance companies at favorable rates, adding a markup, and retailing it to him.

He turned to his wife and said: *"That's the equivalent of you shopping for groceries at the competitor when we already own a grocery store."*

That's the moment. That's when the scales fall off.

You *own* a business that generates capital. You *perform* the banking function every day. But when it comes time to finance your operations, you walk right past your own store and go buy money from someone else — at their markup, on their terms, for their profit.

No rational grocery store owner would stock a competitor's shelves and then buy groceries back at retail. But that's what most business owners do with capital every single day.

You supply it to the banking system for almost nothing. Then you borrow it back at a premium. The spread belongs to someone else.

And you never even question it — because you've been told your whole life that "banking" is something done by buildings with vaults, not by businesses with cash flow.

---

## What If You Captured the Spread?

Here's where this gets interesting.

Imagine you could keep performing the banking function you're already performing — storing capital, deploying capital, managing cash flow — but instead of the spread going to Chase or Wells Fargo or a commercial finance company, it stayed inside *your* system.

You supply the capital. You deploy the capital. You earn the spread.

Not a fantasy. Not a theory. A function you're already performing — just redirected.

The surplus cash that currently earns 0.5% in a checking account? What if it earned 4-5% in a system you controlled, while remaining accessible for deployment into your business whenever you need it?

The interest you currently pay to lenders for equipment, vehicles, and working capital? What if that interest flowed back into a pool you owned — recapitalizing your system instead of enriching a third party?

The banking function doesn't change. The *beneficiary* changes.

You stop being the customer of someone else's banking operation. You start being the owner of your own.

That's not a small shift. For a business owner who finances $200,000 to $500,000 in equipment, vehicles, and operations over a decade, the spread between what they pay to lenders and what they could retain internally isn't measured in hundreds of dollars.

It's measured in hundreds of thousands.

## The Question You Should Be Asking

Most business owners spend enormous energy optimizing their operations. They negotiate vendor prices. They streamline processes. They invest in marketing. They watch every line item on the P&L.

But they never question the one line item that might be the most expensive of all: **the cost of someone else controlling their banking function.**

They accept it as a given. A fixed cost. An unavoidable part of doing business.

It's not.

Banking is a function. You're already performing it. The only question is who profits from it — you or the institution across town.

Nash saw this hiding in plain sight inside a grocery store. A business everyone understands, performing a function nobody recognizes.

Your business is that grocery store. Your cash flow is the inventory. Your financing decisions are the banking function.

And right now, someone else is getting the profit.

**Now let's talk about what those banks REALLY cost your business — and I don't just mean the interest rate.**

- Focused entirely on the conceptual breakthrough: you're already banking, someone else profits
- Nash credited by name — this is his insight and deserves attribution
- Business-specific examples (net-30 terms, inventory, equipment, payroll) replace personal finance examples from source material

**What this article sets up:**
- Article 4 will quantify the true cost (not just interest rate — opportunity cost, lost velocity, external dependency)
