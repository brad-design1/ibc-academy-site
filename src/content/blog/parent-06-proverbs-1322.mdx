## The Verse That Changes Everything

> *"A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous."*
> ΓÇö Proverbs 13:22

Most people read this verse and think: "I should save money for my grandkids."

That's a fine sentiment. But it misses the depth of what Solomon was saying.

Look at the structure: **children's children.** Not just children ΓÇö grandchildren. That's a multi-generational mandate. Solomon isn't talking about writing a bigger check. He's talking about building something that lasts beyond your immediate reach. Something that's still producing when people you'll never meet are benefiting from it.

And notice the contrast: "the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous." The implication is that wealth in the wrong hands ΓÇö without wisdom, without a system, without righteousness ΓÇö doesn't stay there. It transfers to those who know how to steward it.

This isn't just a proverb. It's an economic law. Wealth flows to those who have the systems, knowledge, and discipline to steward it. Away from those who don't.

The question for every parent is: **which side of that equation is your family on?**

## What "Children's Children" Actually Requires

Let's think practically about what it means to leave an inheritance to your *grandchildren* ΓÇö not just your children.

**If you're 35 today:**
- Your children might be 5-10 years old
- Your grandchildren won't be born for another 25-35 years
- Your grandchildren won't be adults for another 45-55 years

That's a 50+ year time horizon. What financial vehicle are you using that reliably works across a 50-year span?

- **A savings account?** Inflation will eat it alive.
- **The stock market?** Over 50 years you'll see multiple crashes, multiple recoveries, and your heirs will need the discipline to not panic-sell during each one. (Most won't have that discipline, statistically.)
- **Real estate?** Properties require management, taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Who's managing them when you're gone?
- **A 401(k)?** Must be withdrawn within 10 years of your death. Fully taxed. Gone before your grandchildren are old enough to benefit.
- **A trust?** Better, but a trust is a legal structure ΓÇö it still requires assets inside it, and those assets are subject to all the problems above.

Now consider a **Family Banking System built on whole life insurance:**

- **The cash value grows every year, guaranteed.** No market crashes. No panic selling. No maintenance.
- **You use it your entire life.** It's not locked up. You borrow against it for cars, college, business, retirement ΓÇö every major purchase.
- **When you die, the death benefit pays out tax-free.** It doesn't matter what the market did. It doesn't need to be "managed." It arrives exactly as promised.
- **Your children continue the system.** They've been watching you use it. They have their own policies. They borrow, repay, grow.
- **Your grandchildren are born into the system.** Their parents start policies on them at birth. By the time they're adults, they have 18+ years of compounding and a system they understand intuitively.

That's Proverbs 13:22 in practice. Not a wish. A system.

## Let's Run the Numbers

I want to make this concrete. Let's walk through a simplified scenario showing how a Family Banking System grows across three generations.

**Generation 1: You (Age 35)**

You start a properly designed whole life policy. You fund it at $15,000/year ($1,250/month). This is your Family Banking System.

Over 40 years, here's roughly what happens:
- **Total premiums paid:** $600,000
- **Cash value at age 75:** ~$1,200,000+ (depending on dividend performance)
- **Death benefit at age 75:** ~$2,000,000+
- **Along the way:** You've borrowed against the policy dozens of times ΓÇö for cars, college, business investments, vacations. Every time, you paid yourself back. The system funded your life while growing.

You die at 75. Your death benefit of $2,000,000 passes **income-tax-free** to your two children.

**Generation 2: Your Children (Each receives $1,000,000)**

Each child is now 45. They've been operating their own policies since age 25 (because you started them early and taught them the system). They've been funding at $12,000/year each.

At age 45, each child has:
- **Their own policy cash value:** ~$350,000
- **Plus the $1,000,000 inheritance** (tax-free)

They use a portion of the inheritance to increase their own policies and start policies on each of their children (your grandchildren). Let's say each starts a $500/month policy on each grandchild.

Over the next 30 years:
- Their own policies continue to grow
- The grandchildren's policies compound from early childhood
- The system now has 4-6+ policies operating simultaneously

When Generation 2 passes away (at, say, 80), their death benefits ΓÇö now multiple policies, multiple millions ΓÇö transfer tax-free to Generation 3.

**Generation 3: Your Grandchildren**

Your grandchildren are now in their 40s-50s. They've had policies running since birth ΓÇö 40-50+ years of compounding. Their parents' death benefits just recapitalized the system.

Each grandchild now has:
- **Their own policy (running 40+ years):** Cash values in the millions
- **A portion of their parents' death benefits:** Additional millions, tax-free
- **A system they've been operating their entire lives**
- **Policies already started on their own children (your great-grandchildren)**

The system isn't just wealthy. It's **self-sustaining.** Each generation adds to it, uses it, and passes it forward ΓÇö stronger than before.

**Total family wealth after three generations:** Potentially $10-20+ million across the system, depending on funding levels, dividend performance, and how many family members participate.

**Starting investment:** $15,000/year from one person.

That's the power of compound interest working across generations inside a system designed to capture and recirculate capital.

## The Biblical Framework

I realize not everyone reading this shares my faith. But for those who do, I want to connect this system to the biblical framework it naturally aligns with.

**Stewardship, not ownership.** The Bible is clear that everything belongs to God. We're stewards ΓÇö managers of resources entrusted to us. A steward's job isn't to hoard or to spend. It's to *deploy wisely and account faithfully.* A Family Banking System is stewardship in action: capital is deployed, returned, and redeployed ΓÇö always growing, always serving the family's mission.

**The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30).** The master didn't praise the servant who buried his talent in the ground. He praised the ones who put their capital to work. Burying money in a savings account or locking it in a 529 is the financial equivalent of burying your talent. Deploying it through a system that grows and multiplies ΓÇö that's what the master rewards.

**Generational thinking.** The Bible repeatedly speaks in generational terms. Abraham was promised blessings for his descendants. The Israelites were told to teach their children and their children's children. The biblical worldview is inherently multi-generational. A financial system that spans generations isn't just smart ΓÇö it's aligned with how God says the world works.

**Provision, not anxiety.** "Do not be anxious about tomorrow" doesn't mean "don't plan." It means don't let fear drive your decisions. A Family Banking System removes financial anxiety by creating a reliable, growing pool of capital that handles life's expenses without crisis. You're not anxious about college costs, car purchases, or retirement because the system handles them. You can focus on what matters: your family, your faith, your mission.

**Generosity as overflow.** When your family's financial house is in order ΓÇö when you have a system that produces more than you need ΓÇö generosity becomes natural, not sacrificial. You give from abundance, not scarcity. Tithing isn't painful when the system is working. Giving to missions, supporting your church, helping families in need ΓÇö these become expressions of overflow, not obligations that stress your budget.

## What This Looks Like in Real Life

Let me paint a picture of a family living Proverbs 13:22 through a Family Banking System:

**Sunday morning.** The family tithes from a place of abundance. Giving is a joy, not a duty. The system produces enough that generosity is built into the budget, not squeezed in at the end.

**The dinner table.** Dad mentions that the family bank funded a rental property this month. The 14-year-old asks how much interest they're paying. Dad explains ΓÇö they're paying interest to the insurance company, but the cash value keeps growing, so the net cost is minimal. The 14-year-old asks if she can borrow from the system for her first car next year. Dad says yes ΓÇö and they'll set up a repayment plan together.

**College decision time.** The 18-year-old is choosing between schools. The family can afford any of them ΓÇö not because they're rich, but because the system has been growing for 18 years. The conversation isn't "Can we afford this?" It's "Which school is the best stewardship of our capital?" The student graduates with zero debt and a deep understanding of how money works.

**A business opportunity.** The 28-year-old has an idea for a business. She borrows $30,000 from her own policy (started at birth, now with 28 years of compounding). No bank application. No credit card debt. No begging investors. She has capital AND a lender who believes in her ΓÇö the family system.

**Grandchildren arrive.** The family starts policies on each grandchild within months of birth. By the time these children are old enough to understand, they'll have policies that have been compounding for years. The system is now in its third generation. Proverbs 13:22 ΓÇö children's children ΓÇö is literally happening.

**A death in the family.** Grandpa passes at 82. The family grieves, but they don't panic financially. The death benefit arrives ΓÇö tax-free ΓÇö and recapitalizes the system. The family meets, discusses how to deploy the capital, and makes decisions together. The system is stronger now than it was before. Grandpa's legacy isn't a memory. It's a living, growing system that will outlast everyone in the room.

## The Choice in Front of You

You've now read six articles. You understand what legacy means (Article 1), how the Family Banking System works (Article 2), how it teaches your kids (Article 3), how it handles college (Article 4), why most families lose their wealth (Article 5), and what Proverbs 13:22 looks like in practice (this article).

The question now is simple: **what are you going to do with this knowledge?**

You have three options:

**Option 1: Nothing.** You close this tab, go back to your regular life, and keep doing what you've been doing. Your money flows through the banking system. The banks profit. You accumulate in retirement accounts you can't touch. You hope your kids figure it out. Statistically, 90% of families in your position will lose their wealth by the third generation. This is the default path.

**Option 2: Learn more.** You're intrigued but not ready to act. That's perfectly fine. Go read Nelson Nash's book, *Becoming Your Own Banker.* Join our free community at IBC Academy. Ask questions. Take your time. This information isn't going anywhere.

**Option 3: Start building.** You're ready. You want to implement a Family Banking System. You want to start a policy designed for maximum cash value ΓÇö one that will serve your family for generations.

If you're at Option 3, the most important thing I can tell you is this: **find a practitioner who understands IBC.** Not a general life insurance agent. Not a financial advisor who's heard of whole life. Someone who has studied Nelson Nash's work, who designs policies for banking (not just death benefit), and who will walk you through the process.

This is too important to get wrong. The vehicle matters. The design matters. The guidance matters.

## A Final Word

When I think about Proverbs 13:22, I don't think about money. I think about my kids sitting at a table 30 years from now, making decisions with wisdom I helped them build. I think about my grandchildren ΓÇö kids I may never meet ΓÇö growing up inside a system that teaches them how money works before anyone has to explain it.

I think about a family that doesn't panic when the market crashes, doesn't stress about college costs, doesn't fight over inheritance, and doesn't lose everything in three generations.

I think about a legacy that's not just financial, but intellectual, spiritual, and practical. A system that embodies stewardship, teaches discipline, rewards patience, and grows across generations.

That's what a good man leaves. Not just money. A system. A way of thinking. A practice that outlasts him.

**That's Proverbs 13:22 in practice.**

And it starts with one decision ΓÇö made by one parent ΓÇö who decides that the way they've always done things isn't the way they have to keep doing them.

If that parent is you, welcome to the journey.
