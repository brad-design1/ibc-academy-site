## You Signed Up for This

Nobody put a gun to your head. Nobody forced you to take out that mortgage, that car loan, that student loan. You signed voluntarily. You even felt good about it. The mortgage meant you were a homeowner. The car loan meant you were responsible. The student loan meant you were investing in yourself.

But let's look at what you actually signed.

When you took out your 30-year mortgage, you agreed to make 360 payments. Miss enough of them, and they take your house. Not their house ΓÇö *your* house. The one with your kids' height marks on the doorframe.

When you financed your car, you agreed to 60 or 72 monthly payments. During that time, the car is technically theirs. Miss the payments, and they send a tow truck at 3 AM.

When you took out student loans, you signed a note that survives bankruptcy. That's right ΓÇö student loans can't even be discharged if you go completely broke. They follow you to the grave.

Each of these agreements has something in common: **you surrendered a claim on your future labor in exchange for something today.** You pre-sold your time. Months and years of it.

And here's what nobody told you: the total cost of all that pre-sold time is staggering.

## The Real Price Tag

Let's add it up for a typical American household:

**Mortgage:** $350,000 at 6.5% for 30 years.
- Monthly payment: $2,212
- Total paid: $796,320
- Interest paid: **$446,320**

**Two car loans:** $35,000 each at 6.5% for 60 months.
- Monthly payment per car: $685
- Total paid per car: $41,100
- Interest paid for both: **$12,200** (and you'll do this 7-8 times in your life, so: **$85,000+**)

**Student loans:** $45,000 at 5.5% for 20 years.
- Monthly payment: $309
- Total paid: $74,160
- Interest paid: **$29,160**

**Credit cards:** Average household carries $10,000 at 22% APR.
- Minimum payments over time: easily **$15,000-$20,000** in interest

**Grand total in lifetime interest:** Conservatively, **$575,000 to $600,000.**

That's not the purchases. That's just the *interest* ΓÇö the fee you pay for the privilege of using someone else's money. Half a million dollars or more, transferred directly from your labor to a bank's balance sheet over your working life.

What would your life look like with an extra $600,000?

## The Invisible Bars

Here's what makes this a prison and not just an expense: **the debt constrains your behavior.**

You can't quit the job you hate because you have a mortgage payment. You can't take a sabbatical because you have car payments. You can't start a business because you can't miss a single paycheck. You can't relocate for a better opportunity because you're underwater on your house.

Every debt obligation is a chain. Not a dramatic, clanking chain ΓÇö a quiet one. The kind that feels normal because everyone else is wearing the same chains. The kind that feels responsible because your financial advisor told you leverage is smart.

But ask yourself this: **If you had zero debt payments, how would your life be different?**

Would you still work at that job? Would you still live in that city? Would you take a risk on that business idea? Would you spend more time with your kids?

For most people, the honest answer to those questions reveals just how much their debt has shaped ΓÇö and limited ΓÇö their life. Not their choices. Their *available* choices. The prison isn't that you made bad decisions. It's that debt removed most of the good options before you even got to decide.

## The Warden Is Your Bank

Here's the part that really burns when you see it.

The bank that holds your mortgage deposits your paycheck and pays you 0.5% interest on your savings. Then they take your savings ΓÇö along with millions of other depositors' savings ΓÇö and lend it out at 6-7%.

**You are funding the very system that's trapping you.**

Your deposit is the raw material. The bank takes it, marks it up, and sells it back to you as a loan. At a massive profit. Then they use the interest you pay to fund more loans to more people, who also deposit their paychecks, which fund more loans, in an endless cycle.

Nelson Nash described this with painful clarity. He said most people spend their lives transferring wealth to banks through the financing function. Not because they're foolish. Because nobody ever showed them the alternative.

And here's the kicker: **the bank doesn't even use its own money.** Most of what banks lend comes from deposits ΓÇö your money and mine. Through fractional reserve banking, they can lend out far more than they actually hold. They're making money on money that isn't theirs.

You deposit $10,000. They keep $1,000 in reserve and lend $9,000 to someone else at 7%. That borrower's purchase ends up deposited in another bank, which keeps $900 and lends $8,100. And on and on. Your $10,000 deposit creates $90,000 or more in loans across the system.

All of which generate interest. None of which flows back to you beyond that 0.5%.

You're not the customer. You're the product.

## The Credit Score Illusion

Want to know how deep the prison goes? Look at how we measure financial health in this country.

We use a **credit score** ΓÇö a number that literally measures how good you are at being in debt.

A perfect 850 credit score means you've been borrowing and repaying consistently for years. You've had multiple credit lines. You've carried balances responsibly. You've been the ideal debtor.

It doesn't measure your net worth. It doesn't measure your savings. It doesn't measure your assets or your income or your financial knowledge. It measures one thing: **how profitable you are to lenders.**

And we compete over it. We brag about it. We check it obsessively. We structure our financial lives around optimizing a metric that was designed by lenders, for lenders, to identify the most reliable sources of interest income.

Nash used to say that once you practice becoming your own banker, you stop caring about credit scores. Because when you control your own capital, you don't need permission from a third party to access money. You don't need their approval. You don't need their score.

The credit score is the prisoner's ranking system. It measures how well you perform within the prison ΓÇö not whether you should be there in the first place.

## The Key That's Been Hidden

So here's the question: If the prison is debt, and the warden is the bank, where's the key?

The conventional answers don't work. "Pay off all your debt" (Dave Ramsey) is like telling a prisoner to file through the bars with a nail file. It's technically possible, but it takes forever, and you're still in the same system when you're done. You've eliminated debt, but you haven't built anything to replace the banking function. You still need the bank for your next major purchase.

"Use debt strategically" (the leverage crowd) is like decorating your cell. You might be more comfortable, but you're still in the cell. You're still dependent on a lender. You're still paying interest. You're still surrendering control.

The key is something different entirely. It's not about eliminating debt or optimizing debt. It's about **taking over the function that debt serves.**

Think about what a loan actually does. It gives you access to capital you don't currently have. The bank provides that access and charges you for it. The interest is their profit for performing this function.

But what if *you* could perform that function? What if you had a pool of capital that you controlled ΓÇö capital that was growing, accessible, and couldn't be frozen, cancelled, or called?

What if, instead of paying interest to a bank, you could finance your own purchases and pay the interest back to yourself?

That's not a hypothetical. That's exactly what Nelson Nash figured out. He called it the Infinite Banking Concept. But before we get into the mechanics, we need to understand the function itself ΓÇö the banking function ΓÇö and why controlling it is the single most important thing you can do for your financial freedom.

That's Article 4.

## A Note Before You Move On

If you're feeling frustrated right now ΓÇö like the system is rigged and there's no way out ΓÇö good. That frustration is appropriate. It means you're seeing clearly.

But here's the thing: the prison only works because you don't know you're in it. Once you see the bars, you can start looking for the door. And the door exists. It's been there the whole time. Millions of dollars flow through a system that was designed centuries ago, and it's available to anyone willing to learn how it works.

Stay with me. The next three articles are where it starts to get exciting.
