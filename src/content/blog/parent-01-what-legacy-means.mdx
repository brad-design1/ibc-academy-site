## The Question Behind the Question

Every parent wants to leave something for their kids. It's hardwired into us. You work hard, you sacrifice, you save ΓÇö because somewhere in the back of your mind, you know it's not just about you.

But here's the question most parents never ask clearly enough:

**What exactly are you leaving?**

If your answer is "money," we need to talk.

Because money ΓÇö a pile of it, sitting in an account, handed over to someone who didn't earn it ΓÇö is one of the most dangerous things you can leave a child. Not because money is bad. But because money without a system is like handing someone a loaded weapon without teaching them how to use it.

## The Three Types of Inheritance

Let me break this down simply. When a parent dies and "leaves something" to their children, that inheritance typically falls into one of three categories:

**1. Assets (Money, Property, Accounts)**

This is what most people think of. The house. The IRA. The savings account. The life insurance payout. It's a lump sum ΓÇö sometimes significant, sometimes modest ΓÇö that transfers from one generation to the next.

Here's the problem: assets get consumed. The average inheritance in America is spent within 19 months. Not invested. Not grown. Spent. The house gets sold. The IRA gets cashed out (and taxed). The savings get divided among siblings who each have their own financial fires to put out.

Assets are necessary, but they're not a legacy by themselves. They're fuel. And fuel without an engine just evaporates.

**2. Values (Character, Work Ethic, Faith)**

This is the stuff you teach at the dinner table. Show up on time. Work hard. Tell the truth. Honor God. Be generous. Save before you spend.

Values are essential ΓÇö and I'd argue they matter more than money. A child with strong values and no money will figure it out. A child with money and no values will destroy themselves and everyone around them.

But here's the uncomfortable truth: values alone don't build wealth. You can raise a kid who works hard, lives below their means, and still ends up on the hamster wheel of paycheck-to-paycheck living ΓÇö because they were never taught a *system* for how money actually works.

Good character without financial literacy is noble poverty. That's not the goal either.

**3. A System (Process, Structure, Knowledge)**

This is the category most families miss entirely. A system is a *way of doing things* ΓÇö a process that produces results regardless of who's operating it.

Think about what makes a family business survive across generations. It's not the founder's charisma. It's the systems they built: the processes, the relationships, the way decisions get made, the institutional knowledge that gets transferred.

Wealth works the same way. The families who build lasting wealth don't just hand over money. They hand over a *system* for managing, growing, and deploying capital. They teach the next generation not just to save, but to think like a banker.

**A real legacy is all three ΓÇö assets, values, AND a system ΓÇö working together.**

## Why Most Families Lose Their Wealth

You've probably heard the statistics:

- 70% of wealthy families lose their wealth by the second generation
- 90% lose it by the third generation

This is sometimes called "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations." The first generation builds it. The second generation maintains it (barely). The third generation spends it.

Why does this happen? It's not because the kids are lazy or stupid. It's because the thing that was transferred was *money* ΓÇö not the system that created the money.

The founder understood risk. They understood capital. They understood the cost of borrowing, the value of saving, the discipline of delayed gratification. They didn't just know these things intellectually ΓÇö they *lived* them. Their entire financial life was a practice.

But when they died, they handed their kids a check, not a practice.

It's like handing someone a garden full of vegetables but never teaching them how to plant seeds. They'll eat for a season. Then they'll starve.

## What a "System" Looks Like in Practice

So what does a financial system look like for a family?

Let me paint the picture. Imagine a family where:

- **There's a family bank.** Not a metaphorical one. An actual pool of capital ΓÇö structured through a properly designed whole life insurance policy ΓÇö that the family can borrow against for major purchases, investments, and opportunities.

- **Every major purchase runs through the system.** Need a car? Borrow from the family bank, pay it back with interest ΓÇö interest that goes back into the family pool, not to a commercial bank. Need to fund college? Same process. Start a business? Same process.

- **The children learn by watching.** They don't get a lecture about compound interest. They see Mom and Dad borrow from their own policy to buy a car, then watch the payments flow back into the family's pool of capital. They see the balance grow. They understand, viscerally, what it means to control the banking function.

- **When the parents pass away, the system doesn't die.** The death benefit replenishes the pool ΓÇö tax-free. The children, who have been using the system their whole lives, continue operating it. They start policies on their own children. The system expands.

- **By the third generation, the family isn't just wealthy ΓÇö they think differently.** They don't ask "Can I afford this?" They ask "How do I finance this through our system?" They don't lose money to banks. They ARE the bank.

That's a legacy. Not a pile of money. A system that produces money, teaches values, and compounds across generations.

## Nelson Nash and the Origin of This Idea

This isn't something I invented. The concept I'm describing ΓÇö becoming your own banker ΓÇö was developed by a man named Nelson Nash. He was a forester by training, not a finance guy. But he spent decades studying how money works, particularly how the banking function operates in every transaction.

His book, *Becoming Your Own Banker* (BYOB), is the foundational text for what's now called the Infinite Banking Concept (IBC). Nash's core insight was simple but profound:

**You finance everything you buy.** Either you pay interest to someone else (a bank, a credit card company, a finance company), or you give up interest you could have earned (the opportunity cost of paying cash). There's no third option.

Most people spend their entire lives making banks wealthy through this financing function. Nash asked: what if you could capture that function for your own family?

The vehicle he identified was dividend-paying whole life insurance from a mutual company ΓÇö not because the insurance itself is magical, but because of the unique contractual features it offers: guaranteed cash value, the ability to borrow against it without disrupting the growth, tax-advantaged access, and a death benefit that transfers tax-free to the next generation.

We'll get deep into the mechanics in Article 2. For now, I just want you to understand the *concept*: a legacy isn't what you leave. It's what you build that keeps working after you're gone.

## The Mindset Shift

Here's what I want you to take away from this first article:

**Stop thinking about legacy as an amount. Start thinking about it as a system.**

If you die tomorrow and your kids inherit $500,000, that's wonderful. But if they don't understand how to manage capital, protect it, grow it, and deploy it wisely, that money will be gone in a decade. Maybe less.

But if you die tomorrow and your kids inherit $500,000 *plus* a system they've been watching you use for 20 years ΓÇö a system they understand, believe in, and know how to operate ΓÇö that $500,000 is just the seed capital for something much bigger.

The money is fuel. The system is the engine. The values are the driver.

You need all three.

## What's Coming Next

In the next article, we're going to get specific. I'll show you what a Family Banking System actually looks like ΓÇö how one policy becomes a multi-generational engine for your family's wealth. We'll talk about the mechanics, the math, and the mindset.

But before you move on, I want you to sit with this question:

**If your children inherited everything you have today, would they know what to do with it?**

Not "would they invest it wisely" ΓÇö that's a different question. I mean: do they have a *system* for managing capital? Have they ever seen you operate one?

If the answer is no, that's not a failure. That's a starting point. And you're exactly where you need to be.
