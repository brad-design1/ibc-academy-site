## You Have a Business Partner You Never Met

In [the last article](/blog/just-curious-01-where-does-money-go), we looked at the staggering amount of money that flows through someone's hands over a lifetime. Two to five million dollars.

But here's what I didn't tell you: someone else benefits from almost every dollar that leaves.

There's a silent partner who shows up every time you finance something. Unlike a real business partner, this one never asks your opinion, never takes any risk, and never fails to collect their share.

## The Partner Who Shows Up Uninvited

Think about your last major purchase. Unless you paid cash, you financed it. You borrowed money and you're paying it back over time.

Here's what that means: every month, a portion of your payment goes somewhere other than the thing you bought. Some reduces what you owe. The rest? Pure profit for someone else.

The bank. The credit union. The finance company.

They take a cut. Every single month. For years.

## Let's Follow the Money

**Your Car**

Finance $30,000 at 6.5% for 72 months. Your monthly payment: $520. Total paid: $37,440. The difference—$7,440—is pure interest.

And most people don't keep cars six years. They trade in around month 36, having paid $5,000 in interest on a car they no longer own. Then they do it again.

Over a driving lifetime, the average person pays $50,000-100,000 in auto loan interest alone.

**Your House**

Finance $240,000 at 7% for 30 years. Monthly payment: $1,596. Total over 30 years: $574,560.

The interest alone: $334,560. More than you borrowed.

You paid for the house. Then you paid for another house worth of interest. The bank got a house too—they just didn't have to mow the lawn.

Most people move every 7-10 years, restarting the amortization schedule each time. You might pay for three houses' worth of interest while only ever owning one.

**Your Credit Cards**

The average household carries $8,000 at 22% interest. Making minimum payments, that takes 27 years to pay off. Total paid: over $24,000. Three times the value. Gone.

## Add It Up

Financial researchers have tried to calculate the total interest burden over a typical American's financial life. The estimates vary, but here's a conservative one:

- Auto loans: $50,000-100,000
- Mortgage: $200,000-400,000
- Credit cards: $40,000-80,000
- Student loans: $25,000-50,000
- Other financing: $20,000-50,000

**Total lifetime interest: $335,000 to $680,000**

Split the difference and call it $400,000.

Four hundred thousand dollars. Not spent on experiences. Not building anything for your family. Not growing or compounding for your future.

Transferred. To someone else's balance sheet. To banks, finance companies, and credit card issuers who did nothing but have money when you didn't.

That's your silent partner. Showing up at every major purchase. Taking their cut before you get yours.

## Why Does No One Talk About This?

Part of it is math. Most people look at the monthly payment—"Can I afford $520?"—and sign. They never calculate what that becomes over a lifetime.

Part of it is normalization. Everyone finances things. It's just how life works.

And part of it is misdirection. The financial industry wants you obsessing over your 401(k) return and comparing credit card rewards. Meanwhile, the real transfer of wealth happens in the *volume*—not the rate.

The rate is a magic trick. The volume is reality.

## The Partners Who Profit

Banks aren't evil. They provide a service and take risk. That's worth something.

But it doesn't change the math.

When you buy a car, the dealership gets paid once. The bank gets paid for years. When you buy a house, the seller walks away. The mortgage company signs up for 30 years of your income. When you swipe a credit card and carry a balance, the issuer starts their meter at 22% annually, compounding monthly.

Every financing decision creates a profit stream for someone else.

Here's what should bother you: they build these profits on your future labor. That $400,000 in lifetime interest represents time. *Your* time. Hours spent working to pay for money you already spent.

The silent partner gets paid first. You get what's left.

## The Question Nobody Asks

When people talk about building wealth, they focus on earning more. Getting a raise. Better investments.

But nobody talks about this leak. Nobody asks: "What if I could redirect some of that $400,000? What would my financial life look like?"

That's the question worth asking.

Because right now, you have a partner in every major financial decision. A partner who profits whether you succeed or fail.

What would it look like to change that relationship?

## Coming Up Next

Now, I know what some people are thinking: "But not all debt is bad. My mortgage is building equity. Some of this is just smart leverage."

You've probably heard terms like "good debt" and "bad debt."

That's what we'll look at next time. The "good debt" myth—and what it really costs you.

Because here's a preview: even "good" debt has a silent partner. And they get paid either way.
