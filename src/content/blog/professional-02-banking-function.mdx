## The Insight That Changes Everything

Nelson Nash's single most important insight wasn't about insurance. It was about banking.

Here's the line that rewired my understanding of money:

**"The banking function in your life is more important than the things you buy."**

When I first read that, I thought it was hyperbole. It's not. It might be the most precisely true statement in personal finance — and almost nobody talks about it.

Let me show you why.

## What Is the Banking Function?

Strip away the marble lobbies and the mobile apps. Forget the brand names. At its core, a bank does two things:

1. It stores capital.
2. It deploys capital.

That's the entire business. Capital flows in. Capital flows out. The bank earns a spread between what it pays depositors and what it charges borrowers. A depositor gets 0.5%. A borrower pays 7%. The bank keeps the difference.

No innovation required. No breakthrough technology. Just positioning — sitting between people who have capital and people who need it.

Nash called this **the banking function**. Not the banking *institution*. Not the banking *industry*. The *function*. Because banking isn't a building you visit. It's a process that happens to every dollar you earn, whether you recognize it or not.

Here's what he meant: Every major financial transaction in your life passes through someone's banking system. Your mortgage. Your car loans. Your student debt. Your credit cards. Your business line of credit. Every one of those transactions generates profit — for whoever controls the banking function.

Right now, that's not you.

## Your Personal Banking Ledger

Let's make this concrete. You earn $250,000 a year. You're disciplined. You save. You invest. You do the things financially competent people do.

And you're still hemorrhaging wealth to the banking function.

Here's what a typical professional at your income level pays over a lifetime:

**Mortgage interest.** A $650,000 home financed at 6.5% over 30 years costs roughly $830,000 in total payments. That's $530,000 in interest alone — money that buys you zero additional square footage. It buys the bank a very nice year. Every year. For thirty years.

**Auto financing.** You'll own 8–10 vehicles over your career. Even financing modestly — $45,000 vehicles at 5.5% over five years — you'll pay $50,000 to $70,000 in interest across your lifetime. For the privilege of driving cars you could have paid for differently.

**Student loans.** Yours may be paid off. But if you're funding your children's education — and at your income level, you probably are — $100,000 in parent loans at 7% generates another $45,000 to $60,000 in interest.

**Credit cards and lines of credit.** Even responsible users carry balances occasionally. A HELOC for a renovation. A bridge between cash flows. Over a lifetime, figure another $20,000 to $40,000.

Add it up.

**$650,000 to $700,000. Conservatively.**

That's not what you spent on houses, cars, and education. That's what you paid *on top of* those purchases — purely to access someone else's banking system.

Seven hundred thousand dollars. Gone. Not invested. Not compounding. Not building your family's wealth. Transferred permanently to institutions that performed a function you never thought to perform yourself.

## The Invisible Tax on High Earners

Here's the part that should bother you most: **the higher your income, the larger your banking function — and the more you lose.**

A family earning $75,000 buys a $250,000 house. A family earning $250,000 buys a $650,000 house. The mortgage is bigger. The interest is bigger. The cars are nicer — and more expensive to finance. The children attend better schools — and more expensive ones.

Your high income doesn't protect you from the banking function. It *amplifies* it. Every additional dollar of income creates additional dollars flowing through banking systems you don't control.

Nash saw this clearly. He watched successful families — doctors, attorneys, business owners — earn tremendous incomes and still struggle to build lasting wealth. Not because they spent foolishly. Because they never recognized that the banking function was extracting hundreds of thousands of dollars from their financial lives.

They were focused on earning more and getting better investment returns. Meanwhile, 34.5 cents of every dollar they earned was bleeding out through interest payments to third-party lenders.

That's not a metaphor. Nash calculated it. More than a third of the average family's income goes directly to financing costs. For high earners with larger mortgages and more complex financial lives, the number can be even higher.

## Banking Is a Function, Not a Building

This is the shift Nash spent his career trying to articulate.

When you hear "banking," you picture a place. A Chase branch. A Wells Fargo app. An institution with a charter and a logo.

But banking is a *verb*. It's something that happens. Capital is stored. Capital is deployed. Interest is earned on the spread. That's the function. And it can be performed by anyone.

Banks aren't magic. They don't create money from nothing (well — fractional reserve lending is a conversation for another day). They take deposits, lend at a higher rate, and keep the difference. The function itself is simple. Ordinary.

The question isn't whether the banking function exists in your life. It does. It's baked into every financial decision you make.

**The question is: who performs it?**

When you deposit your paycheck into a savings account earning 0.5% and then finance a car at 6.5%, someone is earning that 6% spread. It's not you. When you carry a mortgage at 6.5% while your savings sit in a money market at 4.5%, someone is profiting from the gap. It's not you.

You're already participating in the banking function. You've been participating your entire adult life. You're just on the wrong side of every transaction.

## The Grocery Store

Nash had an analogy he used constantly. He said if you understood this one story, the rest of Infinite Banking would be "a piece of cake."

Imagine you own a grocery store. You've invested in the building, the refrigeration, the inventory. Customers come through the front door every day. They fill their carts, pay at the register, and you restock the shelves. The business works.

Now imagine your spouse — who lives with you, who eats the same food — drives past your store every week and buys groceries at the competitor across town. Pays their markup. Funds their payroll. Builds their equity.

You'd think they'd lost their mind.

But that's exactly what you do with money.

You supply capital to banks through your deposits. They pay you almost nothing for the privilege. Then when you need a car, a house, or a line of credit, you go *back to those same banks* and borrow your own capital back — at a markup.

You're stocking someone else's shelves and buying groceries back at retail.

A rational grocery store owner would never do this. He'd shop from his own inventory. When his family needed something, he'd walk to the back and grab it off the shelf. The profit stays inside *his* system. The same dollar works twice — providing for the family *and* generating margin for the business.

That's what owning the banking function looks like.

## You Finance Everything

Here's the line from Nash that serves as the foundation for everything that follows:

**"You finance everything you buy. Either you pay interest to someone else, or you give up the interest you could have earned."**

There is no third option.

When you finance a car through a lender, you pay interest. Obvious. Visible. Written into the loan documents.

When you pay cash for that same car, you *also* finance it — you just don't see the cost. That $50,000, had it remained invested, could have earned 4–5% annually. Over five years, you've foregone $12,000 or more in growth. Economists call it opportunity cost. Nash called it "the interest you could have earned."

Either way, there's a cost. Either way, someone's banking function is at work. The only variable is whether the profit from that function stays inside your financial life — or leaves it permanently.

For a professional earning $250,000, the volume of these transactions is enormous. Every purchase, every financing decision, every deployment of capital runs through *someone's* banking system. The cumulative cost — visible interest plus invisible opportunity cost — is staggering.

You're not just losing the $700,000 in direct interest payments we calculated earlier. You're losing the compounding that money could have generated inside a system you controlled.

## The Question You've Never Been Asked

Most financial advice focuses on two levers: earn more, invest better. Get a raise. Beat the market. Optimize your 401(k) allocation.

Nobody asks the third question — the one Nash spent his career answering:

**Who controls the banking function in your life?**

If you've never considered it, you have your answer. Someone else does. And they're very happy with the arrangement.

You're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the banking function. But that's just the start. Let's talk about where you're parking the money you *do* keep — and why that might be a problem too.
