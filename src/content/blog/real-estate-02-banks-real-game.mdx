## You Think You're the Customer

When you walk into a bank and deposit $100,000 — maybe the proceeds from a flip, maybe savings you've been accumulating for your next deal — you think you're using a service. The bank holds your money. You earn a little interest. When you need the money back, you withdraw it.

That's the story they tell you. It's not wrong exactly. It's just missing the plot.

**You are not the bank's customer. You are the bank's capital source.**

That $100,000 you deposited? The bank doesn't put it in a vault and wait for you to come back. They put it to work immediately. And the spread between what they pay you and what they earn on your money is the most profitable business model in the history of commerce.

Let's look at the actual numbers.

## The Spread

As of right now, most big banks pay somewhere between 0.01% and 0.50% on savings accounts. Let's be generous and say you're getting 0.50% on your $100,000. That's $500 per year.

Now here's what the bank does with your money:

- **Mortgage lending:** 6.5–7.5% interest
- **Auto loans:** 5–9%
- **Credit cards:** 18–29%
- **Commercial real estate:** 7–10%
- **Hard money (through affiliates):** 10–15%
- **Business lines of credit:** 8–12%

But it gets better. They don't just lend your $100,000. Through fractional reserve banking, they lend **multiples** of your deposit.

The reserve requirement (which was actually dropped to 0% in 2020, but let's use the traditional 10% for illustration) means the bank needs to keep $10,000 on hand. The other $90,000 can be lent out. That $90,000 gets deposited into another bank account somewhere. That bank keeps 10% ($9,000) and lends out $81,000. And so on.

Your single $100,000 deposit can support roughly **$1,000,000 in total lending** across the system.

The bank is earning 7%+ on money they created from your deposit, while paying you 0.5% on the original amount.

**This is the most lopsided deal in finance.** And every real estate investor participates in it — on the wrong side.

## Why This Matters for Deal Makers

As a real estate investor, you interact with banks on both sides of this equation, and you lose on both.

**As a depositor:** You park cash between deals earning essentially nothing while the bank lends it to other investors at 7-12%.

**As a borrower:** You pay the bank 7-12% for the privilege of borrowing money that was largely created from other people's deposits. Money the bank didn't earn, didn't save, and didn't risk.

Think about what happens when you go to a bank for a commercial real estate loan:

1. You submit tax returns, bank statements, property financials, and a personal financial statement
2. You wait 30-60 days for underwriting
3. The bank decides whether your deal meets their criteria
4. If approved, you pay an origination fee, appraisal fee, legal fees, and closing costs
5. The bank lends you money they largely created from deposits
6. You pay them 7%+ interest, secured by the property
7. If you miss payments, they take the property

The bank risked nothing they actually earned. They took your deposits (and thousands of other depositors' money), multiplied it through the reserve system, and charged you for access.

Nelson Nash spent decades pointing this out. In *Becoming Your Own Banker*, he wrote that the banking function is the most important part of any financial system — and that most Americans play the role of the customer in every banking transaction they encounter.

**What if you played the role of the bank instead?**

## The Bank's Business Model (Simplified)

Here's what a bank actually does, stripped of all the marble lobbies and friendly tellers:

1. **Attract capital** — Through deposits, paying as little interest as possible
2. **Store capital** — In reserves and investments, maintaining liquidity
3. **Deploy capital** — Through loans, at the highest interest rate the market will bear
4. **Collect the spread** — The difference between what they pay and what they earn
5. **Maintain control** — They decide who borrows, how much, when, and under what conditions

That's it. That's the entire business model. Find money cheap, lend it expensive, control the process.

Now here's what's interesting: **there's nothing magical about step 1.** Banks don't create capital from thin air in a philosophical sense — they attract it from depositors and then multiply it through the system.

You could do the same thing. Not the fractional reserve multiplication (that's a government-granted monopoly), but the core function: **attract capital into a system you control, store it efficiently, and deploy it into opportunities that generate returns.**

The question is: what system would you use?

## How Banks Behave During Downturns

This part is critical for real estate investors, because it reveals the fundamental fragility of depending on banks for capital.

**In good times:** Banks lend freely. HELOCs are approved with generous limits. Commercial loans flow. Hard money lenders compete for your business. Capital feels abundant.

**In bad times:** Banks freeze credit lines. HELOCs get called or reduced. Commercial lending standards tighten dramatically. Hard money lenders raise rates and reduce leverage. Capital disappears.

This is exactly backward from what you need. In a downturn, the best deals appear. Distressed sellers, foreclosure auctions, motivated estate sales — the opportunities multiply. And the capital to seize them evaporates.

This isn't a conspiracy. It's rational behavior from the bank's perspective. They're protecting their depositors (and their shareholders). When the economy contracts, real estate values drop, default rates rise, and banks reduce exposure.

But the effect on you is devastating. **The banking system withdraws capital precisely when deploying it would be most profitable.**

In 2009, investors with access to private capital — capital they controlled, not capital they borrowed — bought assets at 40-60 cents on the dollar. Those purchases generated returns that will compound for decades.

Investors who depended on banks and hard money? They watched from the sidelines, locked out by the same institutions that had been happy to lend six months earlier.

## The Game You Didn't Know You Were Playing

Here's what I want you to see:

Every time you deposit money in a bank, you're funding someone else's lending operation. Every time you borrow from a bank, you're paying someone else for capital they created from deposits just like yours. Every time a bank freezes your HELOC, you're reminded that you never actually controlled that capital.

**You are simultaneously the bank's cheapest source of funds (as a depositor) and one of their most profitable revenue streams (as a borrower).**

The spread between what they pay you and what they charge you is how banks became the most profitable industry in the history of capitalism. JPMorgan Chase alone earned $49.6 billion in net income in 2023. That money came from the spread — from millions of people just like you depositing cheap and borrowing expensive.

Nash's insight was simple: **if the banking function is the most profitable part of the financial system, why would you let someone else perform it?**

## What Playing Their Game Looks Like

Playing the bank's game doesn't mean starting a bank. It means performing the same function — at a personal level — using a vehicle that lets you:

1. **Store capital** in a system that grows guaranteed, regardless of market conditions
2. **Access capital** without permission, credit checks, or underwriting
3. **Maintain growth** on your stored capital even while it's deployed elsewhere
4. **Control the terms** — you decide when to borrow, how much, and when to pay it back
5. **Eliminate counterparty risk** — no one can freeze, reduce, or call your capital

There is a vehicle that does all five of these things. It's been around for over 160 years. It's the most boring, least sexy financial instrument in existence. And it's the backbone of the Infinite Banking Concept.

We'll get into the mechanics in Article 4. But first, you need to understand the invisible cost that's been bleeding your portfolio dry for years — a cost most investors never calculate because they don't even know it exists.

That's opportunity cost. And it's the subject of Article 3.
