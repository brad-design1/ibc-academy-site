## How's That Going?

You came here to debunk Infinite Banking. How's that going?

I'm not being sarcastic. That's a genuine question. You picked up this series because someone mentioned IBC and something didn't sit right. Maybe a friend brought it up. Maybe you saw a YouTube video. Maybe a life insurance agent pitched you something that sounded too smooth, and your gut said *hold on*.

So you came looking for the holes. The catch. The thing nobody was telling you.

Good. That's exactly what a thinking person should do.

But here's where it gets uncomfortable: **What do you do when the data doesn't cooperate with your conclusion?**

## The Journey You Just Took

Let's retrace what happened over these six articles.

**You started skeptical.** We validated that. The life insurance industry *does* have problems. Agents oversell. Products get misrepresented. IULs get dressed up as IBC when they're nothing of the sort. Your skepticism wasn't paranoia—it was pattern recognition. The industry earned your distrust.

**Then we challenged the framework.** "Compared to what?" turned out to be the most important question nobody was asking. Every criticism of whole life insurance compares it to something—usually the S&P 500—without ever questioning whether that comparison makes sense. It doesn't. You don't compare a warehouse to a stock ticker. Different tools. Different functions.

**We dismantled Buy Term and Invest the Difference.** Not with opinions. With math. The strategy that Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman treat as gospel falls apart under real-world conditions: taxes on gains, fees on funds, sequence-of-returns risk, and the inconvenient fact that 97% of term policies never pay a death benefit. Robert Murphy and Carlos Lara showed in the *Lara-Murphy Report* that when you run the numbers honestly—not cherry-picked, not hypothetical—the BTID advantage evaporates.

**We exposed the incentive structures.** Your financial advisor isn't evil. But they earn 1% annually on assets under management. Every dollar you move into a whole life policy is a dollar they stop getting paid on. When they tell you whole life is a bad idea, ask yourself: bad for whom? The advice isn't necessarily wrong because of the incentive—but the incentive means you should verify independently. Which is exactly what you've been doing.

**We looked at the research.** Wade Pfau, a retirement income researcher with no insurance products to sell, found that whole life insurance improved retirement outcomes when included in a diversified strategy. Not because of superior returns. Because of the stability, the guarantees, and the access to capital during down markets when liquidating stocks destroys portfolios. Murphy and Lara reached similar conclusions through Austrian economic analysis. Ryan Griggs showed, in painstaking detail, how every common objection dissolves under the "Compared to What?" framework.

That's not a sales pitch. That's a trail of evidence.

## The Question You Were Never Asking

Here's the reframe that changes everything:

**The question was never "Is whole life insurance a good investment?"**

Your financial advisor was right about one thing: whole life is a terrible investment. It's not designed to be an investment. Comparing cash value growth to the S&P 500 is like comparing a savings account to a startup equity stake. They serve different functions in a financial life.

The real question—the one that Nelson Nash spent the last thirty years of his life trying to get people to ask—is this:

**Who controls the banking function in your life?**

Banking is a function, not a building. It's the process of storing capital and deploying it. Every time you finance a car, a house, business equipment, or an emergency, that function is happening. The only question is whether it happens inside a system you own—or inside someone else's.

When you take a car loan, the bank collects your interest. When you pay cash, you surrender the compounding that money could have produced. Either way, someone profits from the banking function. Either way, you're financing.

Nash didn't invent this reality. He just noticed it. And then he asked: What if you owned the banking system instead of renting it?

## What IBC Actually Is

Let me say it plainly, because six articles in, you've earned the straight version.

The Infinite Banking Concept is a process—not a product—for recapturing the banking function in your personal economy. The tool it uses is a dividend-paying whole life insurance policy from a mutual company, designed with high paid-up additions to maximize cash value accumulation.

It's not "whole life vs. the market." It's not a retirement plan. It's not a get-rich scheme.

It's a system where:

- You build a pool of capital inside a contract you own
- That capital grows every year—guaranteed—regardless of what markets do
- You access that capital through policy loans without credit checks, applications, or permission
- The interest you pay on those loans recirculates through a company you partially own as a mutual policyholder
- Your capital continues compounding even while you're using it as collateral

That's it. No magic. No loopholes. Just a different answer to the question: *Who benefits when I need to finance something?*

Banks have understood this for generations. More than 60% of commercial banks hold whole life insurance on their balance sheets. Corporations hold billions in BOLI—Bank-Owned Life Insurance. The Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, Walt Disney, J.C. Penney—they all used this tool.

It's not a secret. It's just not marketed to you, because the institutions that profit from your conventional banking relationship have no incentive to show you the door.

## The Hard Part

Here's the part nobody talks about in a conclusion: **changing your mind is genuinely difficult.**

You've spent years—maybe decades—operating inside a framework that says whole life insurance is a waste of money. That framework came from people you trust: your advisor, your favorite podcast host, your parents, the internet consensus. It's not easy to look at that framework and say, "I think this might be incomplete."

Nobody enjoys that feeling.

But here's what I've learned, both as a practitioner and as someone who had to go through this same process myself: **you're allowed to update your beliefs when the evidence changes.** That's not weakness. That's not admitting you were stupid. That's intelligence. That's what intellectually honest people do.

You weren't wrong to be skeptical. The information you had supported your conclusions. But now you have different information. You've seen the math on BTID. You've seen the incentive structures. You've read the research from Pfau, Murphy, Lara, Griggs, and Nash himself.

What you do with that information is up to you.

## Where to Go From Here

You have three paths forward. All of them are good.

**Keep learning.** Read Nelson Nash's *Becoming Your Own Banker*. It's short, it's clear, and it's the source material for everything you've encountered in this series. If you've made it through six articles of skeptic-level analysis, you'll find the book refreshingly direct. Nash doesn't sell. He teaches.

**Explore the Foundations path.** This series addressed the skeptic's concerns. The [Foundations series](/blog/just-curious-01-where-does-money-go) starts from a different angle—tracing where your money actually goes over a lifetime and building the case from the ground up. Different entry point, same destination.

**Have a conversation.** If you've done the reading and you want to explore whether IBC fits your specific situation, [schedule a call](/contact). I don't pitch. I don't pressure. If it's not right for you, I'll say so. I'd rather lose a client than violate what I believe.

## One Last Thing

I started this series by saying your skepticism was valid. I meant it. The life insurance industry has earned its critics.

But I also said the critics were asking the wrong questions. And after six articles, I think you can see why.

The problem was never whole life insurance. The problem was how it's been sold—and how it's been evaluated by people using the wrong framework.

When you stop asking "What's the rate of return?" and start asking "Who controls the banking function?"—the entire conversation changes.

You did the work. You looked at the data. You followed the trail wherever it led, even when it led somewhere you didn't expect.

That takes intellectual courage. Most people never bother.

Now you have to decide what to do with what you've found.
