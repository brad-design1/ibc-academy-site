## Introduction

The Infinite Banking Concept (IBC) is a process — not a product. Created by Nelson Nash and outlined in his book *Becoming Your Own Banker*, IBC teaches you how to recapture the banking function in your life using dividend-paying whole life insurance from mutual companies.

## How Does IBC Work?

At its core, IBC is about controlling where your money flows. Instead of sending interest payments to banks, you redirect that money into a specially designed whole life insurance policy that you own and control.

## Why IBC Matters

Most people never think about who controls the banking function in their lives. Understanding this concept is the first step toward financial sovereignty.
