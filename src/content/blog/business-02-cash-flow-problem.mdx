## A Number That Doesn't Add Up

Your business did $1.2 million last year. So why were you stressed about making payroll in March?

Not hypothetically stressed. Actually stressed. The kind where you're staring at the checking account on a Tuesday night, doing math on the back of an envelope, wondering if the deposit from your biggest client will clear before Friday's direct deposits hit.

You're not failing. Your P&L says you're profitable. Your accountant confirmed it. Your tax bill certainly reflects it. And yet there you are, moving money between accounts at 11 PM, trying to bridge a gap that shouldn't exist.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. And you're not bad at business.

You have a timing problem. And it's the most expensive problem nobody talks about.

## Revenue Is Lumpy. Expenses Are Constant.

Here's what business school doesn't teach you—or teaches you in theory but never makes you *feel*:

Your revenue arrives in chunks. Your expenses arrive like clockwork.

Payroll hits every two weeks whether your clients paid their invoices or not. Rent is due on the first. Insurance premiums don't care that your biggest project got delayed by three weeks. Your vendors want net-30, not net-whenever-your-customer-pays-you.

The gap between when money comes in and when money must go out—that's where businesses die. Not from lack of revenue. From lack of timing.

Carlos Lara and Robert Murphy, in their work analyzing business cash flows, identified this as the fundamental structural problem of operating a business. It's not a failure of the owner. It's a feature of how commerce works. Revenue is inherently cyclical and uneven. Obligations are fixed and relentless. The mismatch is baked in.

And every industry has its version.

## The Seasonal Reality

Construction slows in winter. Crews sit idle in January while overhead keeps running. Then spring hits, and suddenly you need to fund materials for six jobs simultaneously—with money you didn't earn for the last three months.

Retail peaks at the holidays. You stock inventory in September and October, spending cash you won't recover until December. If the season underperforms, you're sitting on product and debt into February.

Consulting has feast-and-famine cycles. One quarter you're turning away work. The next quarter, your biggest client pauses their project and your pipeline is empty. Jordan Ellis, a freelance UX designer in Austin, watched his income swing from $8,000 in Q1 to $47,000 in Q2 and back to $12,000 in Q3—all in the same year.

HVAC contractors replace trucks every four years whether the timing is convenient or not. Real estate wholesalers need earnest money in 72 hours or the deal walks. Dental practices carry $200,000 in receivables while their equipment leases don't pause.

The revenue is real. The profit is real. But the cash? The cash is somewhere else, doing something else, on someone else's timeline.

## What You Do Now

You already know how you handle this. You've been doing it for years. Let's name it.

**The credit line.** Your bank extended a $150,000 line of credit when business was good. You draw on it during slow months and pay it down during strong ones. It works—until it doesn't. We'll get to that.

**The SBA loan.** You applied once. Maybe twice. Filled out the paperwork, handed over three years of tax returns, personal financial statements, business plans. Waited six to eight weeks for an answer. Got approved for less than you needed, at terms that made you wince.

**Factoring receivables.** You sold your invoices to a factoring company at 85 cents on the dollar because you needed cash now, not net-60. You left 15% of your revenue on the table because someone else's payment schedule didn't match your payroll schedule.

**Credit cards at 20%.** You put the equipment purchase on a business card because the approval was instant. Then you spent six months paying it off at rates that would make a loan shark blush.

**Or you just waited.** You slowed down vendor payments. You delayed your own paycheck. You asked your spouse to cover the mortgage from the household account. You white-knuckled it until the next big invoice cleared.

Every one of these solutions has the same thing in common: you're asking someone else for permission to bridge a gap in *your* business.

## The Bank's Terms

Let's talk about what the bank actually requires when you need capital.

**Collateral.** They want your house. Or your equipment. Or your accounts receivable. They want something they can seize if things go sideways—even though you've been profitable for a decade.

**Personal guarantees.** Your LLC or S-Corp is supposed to protect your personal assets. But the bank won't lend to the business without your personal signature on the dotted line. So much for limited liability.

**Approval timelines.** You need $50,000 to lock up a deal by Friday. The bank needs two to four weeks to review your application. By the time they approve it, the opportunity is gone. Ray Delgado, an HVAC contractor in Garland, Texas, went through this cycle every time he needed a new service van. Same dealership, same credit app, same wait, same 7.9% rate.

**Lines pulled during downturns.** This is the one nobody warns you about. In 2008, banks pulled credit lines from profitable businesses—not because the businesses were failing, but because the *banks* were scared. In 2020, it happened again. The exact moment you needed your line of credit most was the exact moment it disappeared.

Lara and Murphy documented this pattern extensively. The banking system's incentives are structurally misaligned with the business owner's needs. Banks lend when you don't need it and retract when you do. They profit from the gap between your revenue timing and your expense timing—and they set the terms.

## The Irony

Let's step back and look at what's actually happening here.

You built a business. You took the risk. You made payroll when it was hard. You found the clients, delivered the work, earned the revenue. Your business generates real economic value—real wealth, real jobs, real output.

And yet, to bridge a predictable, recurring timing gap in *your own cash flow*, you have to go hat in hand to an institution that took none of the risk, did none of the work, and serves none of your customers.

You're a profitable business that has to *beg* for capital.

Derek Washington, a real estate wholesaler in Atlanta, lived this reality every time a deal appeared with a deadline. He'd find the property, negotiate the contract, line up the buyer—and then scramble to find $15,000 in earnest money before the window closed. Not because he wasn't successful. Because his capital was locked up, committed, or sitting in someone else's approval queue.

The timing problem isn't about revenue. It's about control. Specifically, who controls the capital that bridges the gap between when you earn and when you must spend.

Right now, that's the bank. And the bank charges you for the privilege.

## The Pattern Nobody Sees

Here's what Lara and Murphy's analysis reveals when you zoom out far enough:

The typical business cash flow pattern—lumpy revenue, fixed expenses, seasonal cycles—creates a *structural dependency* on external banking. It's not a one-time problem you solve and move on from. It's a permanent feature of operating a business. Every quarter, every year, for as long as you're in business, you'll need to bridge that timing gap.

And every quarter, every year, someone else profits from bridging it for you.

The interest on the credit line. The points on the SBA loan. The discount on factored receivables. The 20% on the credit card. It adds up. Over a decade, over a career, over the life of your business—it's not a rounding error. It's one of the largest expenses you'll ever pay. And unlike rent or payroll or materials, it doesn't buy you anything. It just buys you *time*.

Time that belongs to your business. Time that should be yours to control.

## Something You Haven't Considered

You've read this far because you recognize the pattern. You've lived it. You've felt the stress of March payroll, the frustration of bank timelines, the resignation that this is just how business works.

But here's the thing—your business is already doing something banks do. You just don't realize it yet.

In the next article, we'll look at what that means. Not a theory. Not a pitch. Just a closer look at what your business already does with capital—and why banks are so interested in being on the other end of that process.
