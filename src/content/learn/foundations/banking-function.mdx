## What Is the Banking Function?

Nelson Nash taught that the banking function is the most important concept in your financial life. Every time money changes hands, someone is performing the banking function — and profiting from it.

## Why It Matters

When you finance a car, a home, or any major purchase through a traditional bank, you're paying interest to someone else's banking system. That interest — which can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime — leaves your personal economy forever.

## The IBC Solution

The Infinite Banking Concept teaches you how to recapture this function by becoming your own banker through strategically designed dividend-paying whole life insurance policies.
