      <p class="prose-updated">Last updated: January 27, 2025</p>

      <p class="prose-text">
        IBC Academy (ibcacademy.org) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy
        explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your
        information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Analytics</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        We use <a href="https://plausible.io" class="prose-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plausible Analytics</a>,
        a privacy-friendly, open-source analytics tool. Plausible does not use cookies,
        does not collect personal data, and does not track you across websites. All data
        is aggregated — we see page views, referral sources, and general geographic regions,
        but we cannot identify individual visitors.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-text">
        Plausible is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR. No consent banner is
        needed because no personal data is collected or stored.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        IBC Academy does not use cookies. We do not set first-party cookies, third-party
        cookies, or any other tracking cookies. Your browsing experience on our site is
        completely cookie-free.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Newsletter & Form Data</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        If you subscribe to our newsletter, your email address is collected and processed
        through <a href="https://formspree.io" class="prose-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formspree</a>,
        a third-party form handling service. Formspree processes your email address solely
        for the purpose of delivering your subscription request to us.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-text">
        We use your email address only to send you the IBC Academy newsletter and any
        resources you've requested (such as the IBC Starter Guide). We do not sell, rent,
        or share your email address with third parties. You can unsubscribe from the
        newsletter at any time using the unsubscribe link included in every email.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Third-Party Trackers</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        IBC Academy does not use any third-party trackers, advertising pixels, remarketing
        tags, or social media tracking scripts. We do not participate in ad networks or
        data broker programs. Your visit to our site is not tracked by Facebook, Google,
        or any other third-party platform.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">External Links</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        Our site may contain links to external websites (such as Skool, YouTube, or other
        educational resources). These external sites have their own privacy policies that
        govern their data collection practices. We encourage you to review their privacy
        policies before providing any personal information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Data Retention</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        Analytics data collected by Plausible is retained in aggregated form and cannot be
        linked to individual visitors. Newsletter subscriber email addresses are retained
        for as long as the subscription is active. If you unsubscribe, your email address
        will be removed from our mailing list within 30 days.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-text">
        If you wish to have any data associated with you deleted, please contact us using
        the information below and we will process your request promptly.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        IBC Academy is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has
        provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate
        action.
      </p>

      <h2 class="prose-heading">Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p class="prose-text">
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
        on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this
        policy periodically.
