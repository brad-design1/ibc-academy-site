          If you're completely new to IBC, start with the <strong>Foundations</strong> path. These
          eight lessons cover everything you need to understand before diving into the mechanics of
          policy design. You'll learn why traditional banking puts you at a disadvantage, how the
          Infinite Banking Concept flips the script, and what Nelson Nash meant when he said
          "don't be afraid to be your own banker."

        <p class="begin-text">
          If you already understand the basics and want to learn how whole life policies are
          structured, jump to <strong>Policy Mechanics</strong>. And if you've been practicing IBC
          and want to explore advanced applications — family banking, business uses, or real estate
          strategies — head straight to <strong>Advanced Strategies</strong>.
