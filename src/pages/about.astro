        description={"My grandfather funded the college education of all 9 grandchildren through life insurance policies he quietly designed decades earlier. I didn\u2019t have a name for what he did until I read Becoming Your Own Banker by R. Nelson Nash. That book changed everything.\n\nToday, as an Authorized IBC Practitioner and NNI-certified educator, I\u2019m dedicated to helping others understand and implement the Infinite Banking Concept. Through IBC Academy, I provide free, comprehensive education that empowers you to take control of your financial future."}
